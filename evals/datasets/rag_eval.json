    "question": "What are transformer models?",
    "expected_answer": "Transformer models are neural networks that understand and generate sequential data using attention mechanisms instead of recurrence.",
    "answerable": true
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did transformer models replace RNNs for many NLP tasks?",
    "expected_answer": "Transformers replaced RNNs because they support parallel computation and handle long-range dependencies more effectively using attention.",
    "answerable": true
  },
  {
    "question": "What is self-attention and why is it important in transformers?",
    "expected_answer": "Self-attention allows a transformer to focus on different parts of the input sequence regardless of distance, enabling better context understanding.",
    "answerable": true
  },
