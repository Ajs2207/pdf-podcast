      "generated_answer": "Answer:\nA transformer is a type of neural network that has become the foundation for many modern AI systems, especially those that work with language.  \n- **Core idea**: Instead of looking at words one by one, a transformer looks at all words in a sentence at the same time. It uses a mechanism called *self\u2011attention* to decide which words are most important to each other.  \n- **Structure**: It is built with an *encoder\u2013decoder* design. The encoder reads the input (e.g., a sentence) and creates a rich representation of it. The decoder then uses that representation to produce an output (e.g., a translation or a continuation of the text).  \n- **Multi\u2011head attention**: The transformer splits the attention process into several \u201cheads\u201d that can focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously, giving the model a more nuanced understanding.  \n- **Impact**: Because of these attention mechanisms and the ability to process many words in parallel, transformers have dramatically improved the accuracy and speed of language models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT series. They have also opened up new possibilities across many areas of artificial intelligence.\n\nSources:\n- sample.pdf (page 1)",
